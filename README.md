This project aims to automate business workflows by utilizing multi-agent AI systems. By harnessing the capabilities of autonomous AI agents, this framework ensures efficient and effective execution of complex, multi-step tasks.

*Goal:*

Designing effective AI agents and organizing a team of these agents to perform intricate, multi-step tasks seamlessly. Our focus is on creating a collaborative ecosystem where AI agents can communicate and cooperate to achieve common objectives.

**Why AI Agents are Superior to LLMs**

*LLMs:*

- Provide human feedback iteratively to refine responses.

- Primarily function as standalone models requiring external input.

*AI Agents:*

- When LLMs operate autonomously, they transform into AI agents.

- AI agents independently ask and answer questions.

- Capable of continuous learning and adaptation based on task requirements and environmental changes.

*Advantages of Multi-Agent Systems:*

1. Scalability: Easily scale tasks by adding more AI agents.

2. Redundancy: Multiple agents can cover for each other, ensuring task completion.

3. Specialization: Different agents can specialize in various aspects of a task, enhancing overall performance.

4. Collaboration: AI agents can work together, sharing knowledge and strategies to tackle complex problems.

*LLMs + Cognitive Capabilities = Intelligent AI Agents*

### Key Components of AI Agent
- **Role:** Assign specialized role to agents
- **Memory:** Provide agents with short-term, long-term and entity memory
- **Tools:** Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (eg. for web search)
- **Focus:** Break down task, goals and tools and assign multiple AI agents for better performance
- **Guardrails:** Effectively handle errors, hallucinations and infinite loops.
- **Cooperation:** Perform tasks in series, in parallel and hierarchical fashion

### Role Playing:
More specific role = Better response. Gives clear idea about agent's function in the crew.

**Example:** You are a financial analyst v/s you are FINRA approved financial analyst.

```Python
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Extract actionable insights',
  backstory="""You're a data analyst at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business."""
)
```

### Focus:
Assinging too many tasks, tools, context to a single agent, cause losing essential information and hallucinate.

Therefore, break down task, goals and tools and assign to multiple AI agents for better performance.

```Python
research_ai_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)
```

### Tools:
Assign tools to AI Agents and Tasks for improving execution and performance.

```Python
from crewai import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role='Market Research Analyst',
    goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis of the AI industry',
    backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
    tools=[search_tool, web_rag_tool]
)
```

**Note:** Tasks specific tools override an agent's default tools.

```Python
task = Task(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)
```
### Collaboration:
AI agents can work together, sharing knowledge and strategies to tackle complex problems.

**Sequential Collaboration**
Ideal for projects requiring tasks to be completed in a specific order.

```Python
report_crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
  tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, writing_task], # tasks executed in the order of listing, with output of one task serving as context for the next
  process=Process.sequential
)
```
### Hierarchical Collaboration:
- CrewAI automatically creates a manager agent, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent.
- THe manager allocates tasks among crew members based on their roles, tools and capabilities.
- The manager evaluates outcomes to ensure they meet the required standards.
- Set process attribute to Process.hierarchical for Crew object
- set `manager_llm` for Crew Object. Mandatory for hierarchical process

```Python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
)
```

### Parallel Collaboration:
- Tasks can now be executed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing and efficiency improvements

```Python
list_ideas = Task(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)
```

### Guardrails:
Implemented at Framework level to prevrnt hallucinations, errors and infintite loops.

### Memory:
CrewAI provides short-term memory, long-term memory, entity memory, and newly identified contextual memory to help AI agents to remember, reason, and learn from past interactions.

**Advantages of Memory:**
- `More contexual awareness`, leading to more coherent and relevant responses
- `Experience Accumulation`, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.
- `Entity Understanding`, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing understanding.

Enable memory by setting memory=True in the Crew objects arguments.

```Python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Mental Framework for Agent creations

Think of yourself as a **Manager**
Answer 3 questions:
1. What are my goals?
2. What are the Process?
3. What kind of people I would like to hire, to get the work done?

*This will help to create agents (roles, goals, backstory)*

### What makes a great Tool?
- **Versatile:** Hndle Fuzzy inputs and provide strongly typed outputs
- **Caching Mechanism:** Reuse previous results. Caching layer prevent unnecessary requests, stay within rate limits, speed up execution time
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle erors & exceptions. How ? Sending error message to agent and ask agent to retry

*NOTE: CrewAI supports both crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools*

### Mental Framework for Task creations
Think of yourself as a **Manager**
Ask what kind of process and tasks I expect individuals on my team to do.

Task requires min. 3 things:

1. Description
2. Expected_output
3. Agent that will perform the task

*This will help to create tasks (description, expected_output, agent)*

### Multi-agent Collaboration
- **Problem with Sequential Collaboration**
Initial context fades away as tasks flows from agent to agent.
